# Indian-Sign-Language-to-Text-Conversion

The Indian Sign Language has been developed by Indiansignlanguage.org which offers a huge collection of Indian Sign Language (ISL) signs. Each sign has an image, running video and threaded discussions. This project aims to correctly recognize the gesture using a web application which is displayed by via a camera. The dataset used is a combination of ISL-CSLTR Frame Level Words and Images added by us taken using a  DSLR camera.
